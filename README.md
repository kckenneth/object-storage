Check if you have three queries commands.
- `curl` will get files by URL  
- `jq` jason query is a query in dictionary  
- `tee` is a log output  

```
# which curl jq tee

/usr/bin/curl
/usr/bin/jq
/usr/bin/tee
```
If you have, it will show the path. `jq` is default in Ubuntu Debian. If not, install them. 
```
# sudo apt-get install jq
```
