I am driving a Diesel with 150 PS (HP) in the estate version (station wagon) and a max. high speed of approx. 215 km/h (no speed limit in Germany) and approx. 6.7 Litres per 100 km consumption. The link ist a review of a test here in Germany but in english languge. https://youtu.be/Epj8Jza0H6I I hope you watch it, enjoy it and give me a feedback about what you think about a \"German\" Ford Fusion. Enjoy and cheers, Peter\n",

Other than the acceleration I can't see spending the extra $$$ when I can get satisfaction with the 2L ecoboost.  I drive a \"13\" VWCC now and love that car, but I keep looking at the Fusion.\n",

I'm one that doesn't trade in every two years I keep em for the long distance and only then does reliability come into play, after the 75,000 mile mark. I currently daily drive a 2005 Hyundai Elantra with 194,000 miles and engine/transmission run as well as the day it left the lot(I'm second owner) Yes I notice a slight power drop, obviously, but it is still holding up well. All good, but I don't compare reliability factors until after the 75,000 mile mark. 32,000 miles is just getting broke in, in my world.  Good video, bud.\n",

I was a Honda guy for a long time. Had three Accords and three Civics. This Fusion feels like a cross between the two. Roomier than the Civic and more responsive handling than the Accords.Since I didn't want to spend the money for the top of the line Fusion , I miss the leather and other luxury items of my Lincoln and two Sterlings. The front seats support almost as well as the seats in my Volvo. The interior is well layed out but looks a little cheap. The hard plastic gets scratched easily. My 17 year old Lincoln showed very little wear after 120,000 miles. Only time will tell how reliable it is or isn't. I'm getting about 20-22 MPG around town but I just get in and go. I do not idle much. On the Highway I get about 32.\n",

      "Comment by Gerald Scott: I could like the Fusion, except for 2 things. It has four doors, and it's front wheel drive. I simply will not drive a 4 door car (or truck) or a front wheel drive car. A four door car would be fine if I were in the taxi business, but I'm not. Virtually every four door car (and truck) I see has only one person in it. The driver. I think they are ugly. And front wheel drive cars are very fragile, hard to work on, and handle like trash trucks. I grew up in the '70s, when there were plenty of two door rear wheel drive cars and standard cab trucks. With carbureted V8 engines. My dream car is a Riverside Red 1967 Corvette coupe with a carbureted 427/4 speed manual. Completely stock except for the exhaust. I just had to have an exhaust that sounded like such a car should. I also have a 1972 Ford Pinto woodgrain wagon, and a 1969 Ford F-100 351W/automatic standard cab shortbed. I am 58, and have owned a lot of cars and trucks in my life, but never anything with four doors or front wheel drive. Only a couple with EFI, and I didn't like them.\n",

Saves us dough on longer drives and gets us 35-40 mpg in daily driving.  No issues but some interior trim pieces that needed replacing.  And we got it discounted, no money down and a 0% loan.  Very satisfied.\n",

No doubt, Ford Fusion is a great everyday car but come on, comparing any Ford to any Mercedes is not even like comparing apples to oranges but like comparing apples to Japanese Densuke watermelons.\n",

He had no special qualifications and in the end pissed so many people off he got sacked. He loved Supercars and doing the show gave him access to them. ne he liked and bought was a Ford GT 40 replica. (¬£180,000.00), He never managed to complete a single trip in it, Finishing all on the back of recovery trucks. Yet declared it magical? So magical he told them to take it back and demanded a full refund. Then tries to say it was better than (A car he does not like) a Vauxhall Vectra. He tried to compare things like top speed , Cornering, Brakes (Disregarding it wouldn't go) I bought a 10 year old Vauxhall Vectra 2Ltr Automatic. GLS I think. I paid ¬£1,000 for it and it came with a Full 12 month MOT. Me being me I had 5 all new cheap tyres put on and had the brake pads checked. I had that car for 7 years and every year it was less that ¬£100 for work needed and the MOT. I put that down to it being a 2 Ltr which was big enough for the car without going up to the heavier 2.4 V 6 Lump. And the fact that it was an Automatic, They tend to be bought by nice people who do not race them that needed a huge boot. I know what I would like to have put in the boot before they crushed it when I scrapped it. LOL\n",

      "Comment by Erik Sturzebecher: I don't know your situation  and how many kids you have (if any). If you're looking for AWD and clearly you like comfy cars, if you're looking for a reliable daily driver with good space and features, then I would tell you to look at either the Ford Edge Sport, or the Ford Explorer Limited or Sport model. The Edge was just redesigned and in the Sport model it is quiet and gives you a little bit of zip to go with it. If you're looking for a bit more space and you're looking for something on the more comfortable side of things it's really hard to beat what the Explorer Limited offers. You can buy them (after rebates and dealer pricing) in the high 30's to low 40's and they will have every option you can think of! If you want some more power then upgrade to the Explorer Sport with the 365hp TT 3.5L V-6 with the Range Rover Sport suspension Design and the magnetic dampers. Just my opinion, I wish you the best of luck with your new upcoming car.\n",

It still has the original plastics it came with on the floor mats, and I have to say that it is my treasure. I love the Fusion Titanium, giving it the sporty feeling combined with luxury and toughness. By far, my favourite car will always be the Explorer (little gap between 2002 and 2006 models though). Can't wait to see the 2019 version. By the way, Reverse While Driving was my favourite video on your beautyful Fusion. Greetings from Ecuador!\n",

If you don't lean on it; it will get 19 to 20 mpg in city and 32 mpg on highway (68 mph). It is SNEAKY fast especially after you get get a few thousand miles on it. If I could I would let you try mine a while. It would also make it easier to be away from your Mercedes.\n",

Not sure if you want to steer towards GM or not, but not much as far as AWD for sedans go.  If you'd rather upgrade to a small SUV instead, go with the Escape or Edge for Ford, and Terrain or Equinox for GM.  Replacing the truck, depends on if you want another truck or not and what style you want.  If you want to stay with the extended cab, go with an F-150.  If you'd rather have a crew cab, I'd say either Ram 1500 or Sierra/Silverado.\n",

All we got was a closed road & you saying a \"wave of water\" well you have to be in some deep 2-3ft water to get a wave. You always film dashcam style yet we didnt get that footage everyone was asking for. For your pride? Common man your human you made a mistake no biggy we won't hold it against you. So tell me again how the Mercedes is isn't reliable? \n",

I think you are making these videos for click bait reasons. The C63s is a track focused car. No shit even my friends 1996 Ford Taurus was comfortable as Hell compared to that!  Make better content bro then exaggerating topics. Your channel will grow better.

But my parents always did Fords and Mercury. The Fords i grew up with were very reliable  my mother had a 1989 Mercury Cougar brand new we had it for 13 years and when she gave it away it had 319, 000 miles on it with no transmission,  alternator replacement Etc. I think i could see him in a new Taurus. I had a 2005  that I bought it was just a year old transmission went out under 80k miles i was done with Ford cars ever since. I live in Denver now but am originally from Philly. I took a road trip to see my family in Philadelphia. The rental agency gave me a Ford Taurus Limited. I was so surprised it definitely wasn't the Taurus I owned back in 2005 and that thing has some pick up and go that was a fast car and it wasn't an SHO.\n",

      "Comment by vbx: They didn't offer him anything.  They picked up Jason Kidd and Felton (2 guards) way before the Rox made Lin an offer.  Lin in an interview stated it too. When the Rox made an offer, Lin received a call from Houston saying \"we will not match\" and hung up.  They didn't even give a counter offer.  Why would they?  They just picked up Jason Kidd and Felton.    It's obvious the new Coach didn't like Lin and wanted Melo to be happy. \n",

The guy was overrated anyway. He was all the media was talking about when the Knicks were on their brief winning streak. Once they went on a streak of losing 9 out of 12 games, the \"Linsanity\" talk decreased. He may not have the smugness of Kobe or the anger issues of Artest but I still got sick of hearing about him.\n",
